# MDDB
MDDB is a database that is intended for medical doctors. It can store and add patient infos into a mysql databse and it is highly configurable. Made by 3arii.

MDDB is an acronym for Medical Doctor Database. It is highly configurable with little to no programming experience. MDDB is not hosted in a external linux machine so you must either host it in a linux machine of your own or just do it in localhost the latter is recommended but both of them are acceptable and viable.

How to use MDDB:

1 - You must download mysql in your own machine refer to mysql documentation for further introduction and if any problems present itself.(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/)

2- Configure it, create a new user or keep on using root which isn't reccomended. Then change the first lines in MDDB.py to however you have configured it. You can now freely use MDDB.

THank you for using my project any addition is more than welcome and hopefully I was able to help you.
